Create a simple offline Chrome Web Store website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website should:

Display Extensions:

Load extension data from a JSON file containing the following fields for each extension:
id: A unique identifier for the extension.
name: The name of the extension.
description: A short description of the extension.
version: The version of the extension.
author: The author's name or organization.
iconUrl: A URL or relative path to the extension's icon image.
downloadUrl: A URL or relative path to download the extension's .crx file.
rating: The average user rating (1-5).
Extension Cards:

Display each extension as a card with the following details:
Icon image.
Name.
Description (limited to 100 characters with a "Read more" option).
Version.
Author.
Average rating (displayed as stars).
A "Download" button linked to the downloadUrl.
Search and Filter:

Include a search bar to filter extensions by name or description.
Add a filter dropdown to sort by rating or author.
Styling:

Use clean and modern CSS styling.
Ensure the layout is responsive for desktop and mobile devices.
Functionality:

Use vanilla JavaScript to fetch the JSON data and render the cards dynamically.
Handle edge cases such as missing fields or icons.
Hereâ€™s a sample JSON structure for testing:
